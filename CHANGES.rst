Changelog
=========

1.9.2 (unreleased)
------------------

- Fix RelatedItemsWidget calling self.items, which was turned back into a
  property in z3c.form 3.2.11. (Used in Plone > 4.3.11) [fredvd]


1.9.1 (2017-02-12)
------------------

- Fix value for at.AjaxSelectWidget when the edit form returns with
  validation errors
  [petschki]

- Use the RAW text for Archetypes based TinyMCE content, this fixes
  image handling with TinyMCE.
  [pcdummy]

- Possible to use Rich Text (TinyMCE 4, properly configured) pattern
  in Dexterity types other than plone.app.contenttypes implementation,
  with consistent behavior with other uses of TinyMCE on Plone 4 sites.
  This is useful for Plone 4 sites wanting to use plone.app.widgets
  wthout requiring plone.app.contentypes.
  [seanupton]

- Update README with notes regarding rich text widget.
  [seanupton]

- Update widgets bundle to the latest (2.3.0 - unreleased, 2016-08-18).
  This includes minor widget improvements for related items widget,
  for icon compatibility with Plone 4, and button display style.  It
  also fixes progress bar styles for upload pattern as used in TinyMCE.
  [seanupton]

- Now possible to clear Archetypes date/time field value, replacing any
  previous value with empty value, when desired for both date and datetime.
  [seanupton]

- TinyMCE folder context adjusted appropriately for use in static text
  portlet: uploads now work, browsing now starts at appropriate root.
  [seanupton]

- Expose alternate RichTextFieldWidget factory, not tightly bound to
  plone.app.contenttypes, when plone.app.contenttypes is not installed.
  This may be useful for use by static text portlet, other Dexterity
  content types on sties where plone.app.contenttypes is not in use.
  [seanupton]

- Enable pasting of foreground, background color if and only if the
  foreground and background color toolbar buttons are enabled for editing.
  [seanupton]

- Browser spell check enabled by default; this is usually desired for most
  editing, and low-risk.  Users can use Shift + right-click (Firefox)
  or Control + right-click (Chrome) to show correction suggestions.
  [seanupton]

- Related items options computes context for all z3c.form based forms,
  not just add forms. This is congruent with how plone.app.widgets 2.0.4+.
  [seanupton]

- Omit 'folderTypes' parameter from configuration of related items widget.
  This is no longer used by mockup 2.x.
  [seanupton]

- Related items data converter supports explicit value_type specified in
  field when using collections of UUID values.  This is backward-compatible
  with previous conversion to field values, supports str/unicode value(s),
  whichever is specified by field (backported from related change to
  plone.app.z3cform 2.0.1).
  [seanupton]


1.9 (2016-06-21)
----------------

- Upgrade widgets bundle to latest version (2.3.0 - unreleased).
  [thet]

- update mockup widgets bundle and fix ``get_tinymce_options``
  to return plugins as list (like Plone 5 does ...
  see https://github.com/plone/mockup/commit/efd02e50904f55299eb7f00eddc6c9fcf762ffb1)
  [petschki]

- fix vocabulary lookup for related items widget.
  [petschki]

- Ensure vocabulary lookup works on add forms for related items widget.
  [alecm]

- Add navigation root support to related items widget. Fix incorrect options
  merge for TinyMCE widget.
  [alecm]

- Support Plone 4.x TinyMCE table styles enumerated in control panel via
  TinyMCE 4 configuration property 'table_class_list'.
  [seanupton]

- Incorporate 'textcolor' plugin into configuration.  This ships with
  the included TinyMCE, and has configurable 'forecolor' and 'backcolor'
  buttons in Plone 4 TinyMCE control panel.
  [seanupton]

- Fix vocabulary item path. This fixes issues when browsing through
  collective.lineage subsites.
  [petschki]

- ignore missing/broken RelationValues in RelatedItemsWidget
  [petschki]

- Change the past/future years and time interval of pickadate to the
  registry settings
  [petschki]

- Allow time options to be customized for DatetimeWidget.
  [thet]

- Let ``@@getVocabulary`` return the vocabulary's value instead of the token
  for the id in the result set. The token is binary encoded and leads to
  encoding errors when selecting a value with non-ASCII data from vocabulary
  list in a select2 based widget.
  Fixes: https://github.com/plone/Products.CMFPlone/issues/650
  [thet]


1.8.0 (2015-05-25)
------------------

- Register the ``plonejsi18n`` view for all contexts, so that it can be called
  also on the Zope root. If no base url is found, it's called on "/".
  [thet]

- Allow ``getVocabulary`` calls without a fieldname on INavigationRoot instead
  of IPloneSiteRoot. This adds compatibility for Lineage based subsites.
  [thet]

- Use widget bundle from mockup's build directory, if mockup is installed. In
  this case, you need to build the widgets bundle in the mockup directory.
  [thet]

- Implement selectableTypes for the RelatedItems pattern
  [petschki]

- Include TinyMCE languages from mockup.
  [petschki]

- Change TinyMCE pattern options: Add the folderTypes list to the RelatedItems
  widget in TinyMCE (fixes issues with the tinymce configuration option
  ``containsobjects`` not being respected), set the RelatedItems widget mode to
  browse and set the basePath to the current folder (starts the RelatedItems
  widget in the insert link and image dialogs from the current folder, where
  one can browse down the content tree).
  [thet]

- Update the mockup widget bundle.
  [thet]

- Allow the JavaScript and CSS resources to be cachable and cookable. Set
  applyPrefix for the CSS resource.
  [thet]

- Add the ``form_tabbing.js`` and ``toc.js`` scripts to the deprecated bundles.
  They're made obsolete by ``mockup-patterns-autotoc``.
  [thet]

- Include TinyMCE configuration from plone control panel (unfinished)
  [frisi, petschki]

- Raise minimum ``Products.CMFPlone`` requirement to 4.3.4 to ensure
  compatibility with jQuery 1.9+. jQuery 1.11.1 is included in recent
  ``mockup``.
  [thet]

- Always include CSS and JS SourceMap files. They are only loaded, when the
  browser's developer console is open. Replaces previous behavior, where
  uninified (and broken) resources were loaded when mockup was installed, which
  was also an ugly implicit development mode behavior.
  [thet]

- Use a mimetype selector for richtext areas, if multiple mimetypes are allowed.
  [thet]

- Allow to remove a selected option in the ``select2`` widget if the field
  is not required
  [frapell]

- Test fixes.
  [thet]

- add jsi18n integration
  [vangheem, kiorky]


1.7.0 (2014-07-15)
------------------

- Remove configuration of plone.app.event's ``start`` and ``end`` fields in the
  ``dx_bbb`` module. Requires ``plone.app.event >= 1.2``, which does the widget
  configuration by itself. There is no point in using a previous version of
  plone.app.event together with plone.app.widgets.
  [thet]

- Store RelatedItems in correct order.
  [garbas]

1.6.0 (2014-04-20)
------------------

- Add default_timezone widget attribute to the Dexterity DatetimeWidget. If
  used and set to a valid Olson DB/pytz timezone identifier or to an callback
  returning such, the datetime object returned by the widget will be localized
  to that timezone.  This changes the timezone related behavior from version
  1.4.0.
  [thet]

- Change the start and end date fields of Products.ATContentTypes ATEvent
  types to use plone.app.widgets.
  [thet]

- For Dexterity DatetimeWidgetConverter, when converting to the field value,
  try to localize the value, if the old value is a timezone aware datetime
  object. It uses the 'timezone' attribute on the widget's context, if
  available, otherwise UTC.  We do not use the tzinfo object in the first
  place, because it might already be converted from user's input timezone to
  UTC, as it is the case with plone.app.event.
  [thet]

- Support query arguments for function based vocabularies.
