Changelog
=========

1.8.0 (unreleased)
------------------

- implement selectableTypes for relateditems pattern
  [petschki]

- Include TinyMCE languages from mockup.
  [petschki]

- Raise minimum ``Products.CMFPlone`` requirement to 4.3.4 to ensure
  compatibility with jQuery 1.9+. jQuery 1.11.1 is included in recent
  ``mockup``.
  [thet]

- Always include CSS and JS SourceMap files. They are only loaded, when the
  browser's developer console is open. Replaces previous behavior, where
  uninified (and broken) resources were loaded when mockup was installed, which
  was also an ugly implicit development mode behavior.
  [thet]

- Use a mimetype selector for richtext areas, if multiple mimetypes are allowed.
  [thet]

- Allow to remove a selected option in the ``select2`` widget if the field
  is not required
  [frapell]

- Test fixes.
  [thet]

  [vangheem, kiorky]


1.7.0 (2014-07-15)
------------------

- Remove configuration of plone.app.event's ``start`` and ``end`` fields in the
  ``dx_bbb`` module. Requires ``plone.app.event >= 1.2``, which does the widget
  configuration by itself. There is no point in using a previous version of
  plone.app.event together with plone.app.widgets.
  [thet]

- Store RelatedItems in correct order.
  [garbas]

1.6.0 (2014-04-20)
------------------

- Add default_timezone widget attribute to the Dexterity DatetimeWidget. If
  used and set to a valid Olson DB/pytz timezone identifier or to an callback
  returning such, the datetime object returned by the widget will be localized
  to that timezone.  This changes the timezone related behavior from version
  1.4.0.

  types to use plone.app.widgets.
  [thet]

- For Dexterity DatetimeWidgetConverter, when converting to the field value,
  try to localize the value, if the old value is a timezone aware datetime
  object. It uses the 'timezone' attribute on the widget's context, if
  available, otherwise UTC.  We do not use the tzinfo object in the first
  place, because it might already be converted from user's input timezone to
  UTC, as it is the case with plone.app.event.
  [thet]
